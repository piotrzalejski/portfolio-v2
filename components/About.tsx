        From the world of sales to the coding universe â€“ that&apos;s been my
        journey so far. I&apos;ve got a knack for making deals happen, but now
        I&apos;m all about making lines of code dance.

        I kicked off my tech adventure at a bootcamp, then I landed roles as a
        SWET / QA engineer, making sure software plays nice and does what
        it&apos;s supposed to. But hey, I&apos;ve got my ðŸ‘€ set on full-fledged
        development â€“ it&apos;s where the real fun begins.

        When I&apos;m not glued to the keyboard, you&apos;ll find me hanging out
        with my amazing wife, two kiddos, and our four-legged buddy. We&apos;re
        a crew that loves hitting the slopes, diving into the lake, and cruising
        on bikes. Life&apos;s a blend of family, coding dreams, and outdoor
        thrills â€“ wouldn&apos;t have it any other way! ðŸš€âœ¨
