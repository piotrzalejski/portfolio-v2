        From the world of sales to the coding universe â€“ that's been my journey
        so far. I've got a knack for making deals happen, but now I'm all about
        making lines of code dance.

        I kicked off my tech adventure at a bootcamp, then I landed roles as a
        SWET / QA engineer, making sure software plays nice and does what it's
        supposed to. But hey, I've got my ðŸ‘€ set on full-fledged development â€“
        it's where the real fun begins.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-3'>
        When I'm not glued to the keyboard, you'll find me hanging out with my
        amazing wife, two kiddos, and our four-legged buddy. We're a crew that
        loves hitting the slopes, diving into the lake, and cruising on bikes.
        Life's a blend of family, coding dreams, and outdoor thrills â€“ wouldn't
        have it any other way! ðŸš€âœ¨
